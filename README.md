Usage
----

`MusicTheory` adds a bunch of basic enums and structs that you can define pretty much any music related data. Most importants are `Pitch`, `Key`, `Scale` and `Chord`.   

All data types conforms `Codable`, `CustomStringConvertable`.  
`Pitch`, and `Accident` structs are `RawPresentable` with `Int` as well as `ExpressibleByIntegerLiteral` that you can represent them directly with `Int`s.

#### `Pitch` and `Key`

- All keys can be defined with `Key` struct. 
- It has a `KeyType` where you can set the base key like C, D, A, G, and an `Accidental` where it can be `.natural`, `.flat`, `sharp` or more specific like `.sharps(amount: 3)`.
- You can create `Pitch`es with a `Key` and octave.
- Also, you can create `Pitch`es with MIDI note number. `rawValue` of a pitch is its MIDI note number.
- `Pitch`, `Key`, `Accidental` structs are equatable, `+` and `-` custom operators defined for making calculations easier.
- Also, there are other helper functions or properties like frequency of a note.
- You can define them with directly string representations as well.

``` swift
let dFlat = Key(type: d, accidental: .flat)
let c4 = Pitch(key: Key(type: .c), octave: 4)
let aSharp: Key = "a#" // Key(type: .a, accidental: .sharp)
let gFlat3: Pitch = "gb3" // or "g♭3" or "Gb3" is Pitch(key: (type: .g, accidental: .flat), octave: 3)
```

#### `Interval`

- Intervals are halfsteps between pitches.
- They are `IntegerLiteral` and you can make add/substract them between themselves, notes or note types.
- You can build up a custom interval with its quality, degree and semitone properties.
- You can build scales or chords from intervals.
- Minor, major, perfect, augmented and diminished intervals up to 2 octaves are predefined.

#### `ScaleType` and `Scale`

- `ScaleType` enum defines a lot of readymade scales.
- Also, you can create a custom scale type by `ScaleType.custom(intervals: [Interval], description: String)` 
- `Scale` defines a scale with a scale type and root key.
- You can generate notes of scale in an octave range.
- Also you can generate `HarmonicField` of a scale.
- Harmonic field is all possible triad, tetrad or extended chords in a scale.

``` swift
let c = Key(type: .c)
let maj: ScaleType = .major
let cMaj = Scale(type: maj, key: c)
```

#### `ChordType` and `Chord`

- `ChordType` is a struct with `ChordPart`s which are building blocks of chords.
- You can define any chord existing with `ChordType`.
- Thirds, fifths, sixths, sevenths and extensions are parts of the `ChordType`. 
- Each of them also structs which conforms `ChordPart` protocol.
- `Chord` defines chords with type and a root key.
- You can generate notes of chord in any octave range.
- You can generate inversions of any chord.

``` swift
let m13 = ChordType(
  third: .minor,
  seventh: .dominant,
  extensions: [
    ChordExtensionType(type: .thirteenth)
  ])
let cm13 = Chord(type: m13, key: Key(type: .c))
```

- You can generate chord progressions with `ChordProgression` enum.
- For any scale, in any harmonic field, for any inversion.

``` swift
let progression = ChordProgression.i_ii_vi_iv
let cSharpHarmonicMinorTriadsProgression = progression.chords(
  for: cSharpHarmonicMinor,
  harmonicField: .triad,
  inversion: 0)
```

#### `Tempo` and `TimeSignature`

- Tempo is a helper struct to define timings in your music app.
- TimeSignature is number of beats in per measure and `NoteValue` of each beat.
- You can calculate notes duration in any tempo by ther `NoteValue`.
- Note value defines the note's duration in a beat. It could be whole note, half note, quarter note, 8th, 16th or 32nd note.
